# Deploy status — where we are now

**📅 Last updated: 2026-05-26**

Point-in-time view of which deploy setup scripts have run + what's
blocked on what + the exact command to advance one step. Paired
with [`deploy-architecture.md`](./deploy-architecture.md), which
captures the static "everything that should exist" map; this doc
captures "what actually exists today" and updates each time a
script gets executed.

> **Last verified: 2026-05-26 (via live `az` queries against the

> **Why a separate doc:** the architecture map describes a steady

> different lifecycles, two docs.

### Detail per step

| # | Script | Status | Evidence (live verification commands) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `setup-azure-devops.sh` | ✅ Done | `az devops project list --org https://dev.azure.com/skintyeenation` shows `devops`; `az repos show ... --repository webfront` returns the repo |
| 2 | `setup-sharepoint-pipeline.sh` | ✅ Done | `publish-docs-to-sharepoint` pipeline registered + green runs; SC `sharepoint-docs-sc`; variable group `sharepoint-docs`; Entra apps `it-project-docs-publisher` (`0d6f0c13-…`) + `skintyeenation-admin-cli` (`cc85d6bc-…`) |
| 3 | `setup-api-azure.sh` | ❌ Not run | No `skintyee-prod-rg` in `az group list`; no ACR `skintyeeprodacr`; no Postgres `skintyee-prod-pg`; no Container Apps env; no `skintyee-prod-deploy` Entra app; no `skintyee-prod-azure` SC |
| 4 | `setup-lookup-azure.sh` | ❌ Not run | No `lookup-prod` Container App |
| 5 | `setup-app-web-azure.sh` | ❌ Not run | No `skintyee-prod-app` Static Web App |
| 6 | `setup-lookup-app-web-azure.sh` | ❌ Not run | No `skintyee-prod-lookup-app` Static Web App |
| 7 | `setup-eas-app.sh` | ❌ Not run | No `EXPO_TOKEN` in any variable group; `app/` has no EAS project ID in `app.config.js` |

## Exact next command

```bash
bash scripts/setup-api-azure.sh --dry-run    # preview, no changes
bash scripts/setup-api-azure.sh              # for real
```

> Resource-provider registration (`Microsoft.App`,
> `Microsoft.OperationalInsights`, `Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL`,
> `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry`) is now handled by the script
> itself as Step 0. On a fresh subscription it adds ~3 min to the
> first run; subsequent runs are a no-op (each provider's state
> is checked first, registered only if needed). The SWA scripts
> (Steps 5 + 6) self-register `Microsoft.Web` the same way.

What it provisions (~10 min, Postgres is the slow part):

- Resource group `skintyee-prod-rg`
- ACR `skintyeeprodacr` (Basic SKU)
- Postgres Flexible Server `skintyee-prod-pg` (B1ms + PostGIS, db `api`) — **prompts for admin password mid-flow**, save to 1Password IT/Admin vault
- Container Apps environment `skintyee-prod-env`
- Container App `api-prod` (placeholder image; pipeline replaces it on first push)
- Entra app `skintyee-prod-deploy` + AcrPush + Container App Contributor role assignments + federated credential for ADO
- ADO service connection `skintyee-prod-azure` (federated, no secrets)
- ADO variable group `skintyee-prod-azure` with resource names
- ADO pipeline `deploy-api` registered (off `azure-pipelines/Deployments/deploy-api.yml`)

After Step 3 completes, update the status table at the top of this
file to ✅ Done, push, and Steps 4 + 5 unblock.

## What each subsequent step does

(Brief summaries — full plans in
[`deployment-plan.md`](./deployment-plan.md) for #3–#6 and
[`app-deploy-eas.md`](./app-deploy-eas.md) for #7.)

| # | After running it | Cost (CAD/mo) added |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `api-prod` Container App + Postgres + ACR + the shared deploy infra are live; first `git push` touching `api/**` triggers `deploy-api` pipeline | ~$25 |
| 4 | `lookup-prod` Container App live with always-on min-1-replica + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret; first `git push` touching `lookup/api/**` triggers `deploy-lookup` | ~$13 |
| 5 | `app.skintyee.ca` Static Web App (community app web) live; PRs touching `app/**` get auto-deployed preview URLs | $0 (Free tier) |
| 6 | `lookup-app.skintyee.ca` Static Web App live; same PR-preview workflow | $0 (Free tier) |
| 7 | `build-app` pipeline registered; native iOS + Android builds via EAS Build when pushed | $0 (≤30 builds/mo Free tier) |

## Parallel tracks (independent of #3–#7)

These can be done any time, in any order:

| Track | Status | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| **GoDaddy DNS — M365 email records** (MX, SPF, DKIM, autodiscover, DMARC at `@skintyee.ca`) | ✅ Done (2026-05-26) — verify with `dig +short MX skintyee.ca` | [`../365/setup-skintyee-ca-email.md`](../365/setup-skintyee-ca-email.md) |
| **GoDaddy DNS — service subdomain CNAMEs** (`api`, `app`, `lookup`, `lookup-app`) | ⬜ Pending — wait until each service's Azure resource exists (after Steps 3–6) | [`../godaddy/subdomains-for-azure-services.md`](../godaddy/subdomains-for-azure-services.md) |
| **Delete leaked client secret** on `it-project-docs-publisher` (KeyId `381663c1-…`) | ⬜ Pending — federated path doesn't use it; safe to delete | One-line: `az ad app credential delete --id 0d6f0c13-86a7-4057-801b-a3ec8eb40082 --key-id 381663c1-d314-4991-9289-27694958c892` |
| **Apple Developer Program enrollment** ($99 USD/yr) | ⬜ Pending — prerequisite for Step 7's iOS distribution | [`app-deploy-eas.md § What you'll need`](./app-deploy-eas.md) |
| **Google Play Console enrollment** ($25 USD one-time) | ⬜ Pending — prerequisite for Step 7's Android distribution | same as above |

## How to update this doc

After running a setup script (or completing a parallel-track item):

1. Verify with the relevant `az` query (see the "Evidence" column).
2. Flip the row's status in the table at the top to ✅ Done.
3. Update the "Last verified" date at the top.
4. Commit + push: `git commit -m "docs(deploy-status): step N complete"`.

Keeping this doc current is the cheapest way to know "where are
we?" without `az group list`-ing everything every time.
